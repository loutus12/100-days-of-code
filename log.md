**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: January 3, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It was hard to motivate myself to do it today but it was for only thirty minutes today. I have no desk so my back hurts from working on my bed. I have an idea for an app, but I don't have the skills for it. I still think this is not for me but this challenge is encouraging me to keep trying. I watched a video that good developers are those who are passionate about coding and those who are only looking for money are not very good.  

### Day 4: January 4, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I was getting bored at times but it was cool to learn about animation. Atleast I did it, and at the end of this challenge I will learn if this is for me. 

### Day 5: January 5, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I was able to get through it and it wasn't as boring as usual. I listened to a really good playlist as I coded. I was also able to use the typing skills that I'm practising.
